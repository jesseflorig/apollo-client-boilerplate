# Apollo Client Boilerplate
This is a React Apollo client boilerplate to be used with my [Apollo Server Boilerplate](https://github.com/jesseflorig/apollo-server-boilerplate)

## Setup
Clone the repo, install requirements and run `npm start` in the project root (you'll need to make sure your Apollo client `uri` is pointed to a valid graphql endpoint).
```
git clone git@github.com:jesseflorig/apollo-client-boilerplate.git
cd apollo-client-boilerplate
npm install
npm start
```

## Todo
 - [ ] Create front end queries
 - [ ] Create front end mutations
